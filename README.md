An implemenation of Connect Four in Ruby. 

This project was focused on utilizing TDD (Test Driven Development) in order to create Connect Four.


My first attempt was to use my recent lessons in graphs to try and create a graph-connect four system. After struggling to find a solution for finding a winner by connecting nodes, I decided I was overcomplicating my design, and did some research on other connect four implementations. I decided a string based approach would be much easier.
